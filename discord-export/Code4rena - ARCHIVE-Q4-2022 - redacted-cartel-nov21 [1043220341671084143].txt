can you try modifying `scripts/loadEnv.sh` to use your own alchemy arb-mainnet FORK_URL?

[11/21/2022 22:49] calabashsquash
I have tried that, using a private Alchemy one.

I have done it already but it does not solve the issue. It seems random.

[11/21/2022 22:50] illilli000
hmm, not sure. when I was testing things I know the tests took a long time to run, but I never hit any errors. the sponsor will have to help debug what's going on here


[11/21/2022 22:57] calabashsquash
It seems like it could be just some classic Arbitrum RPC issues. The same issue has randomly (yet consistently) disappeared for me now with nothing changed.


[11/21/2022 23:00] aviggiano
Yeah I changed the RPC and now it's working


[11/21/2022 23:01] clems4ever
For me the problem reappears now and then, I'm using the Alchemy RPC url but I had the same issue with the original url.

[11/22/2022 00:00] calabashsquash
I think it's OK if the response is empty. What is the output of `ls lib`?

Will have to get back to you on this. Just stepped out. Thanks for the help so far though.


[11/22/2022 00:10] kiki_dev
Sorry to jump in but I tried to install dependencies with forge i. And it didn’t work. Is there something i need to do prior to that for installing dependencies with forge i?


[11/22/2022 00:34] carrotsmuggler (pinned)
when cloning, use --recursive to download the solmate submodules as well


[11/22/2022 00:35] carrotsmuggler
use --recursive when cloning to install submodules. check the debug command at the end of the readme, it use --recurse-submodules which is the same thing

{Reactions}
thankyou 

[11/22/2022 01:16] ppmoon69
For those with issues running the tests reliably/quickly, Alchemy has been very reliable for us as a node provider, and the number of fuzz runs can be reduced by configuring the foundry.toml file

If you're using forge across multiple projects or different chains, clearing its cache may sometimes solve obscure issues related to it

@kp - no DMs, ty @never could you please help me?


[11/22/2022 02:06] ladboy233
is this only because of the RPC endpoint?

Nope. private arbitrium alchemy RPC gets me the same result.


[11/22/2022 02:08] ladboy233

```


[11/22/2022 02:09] ladboy233
Am I wrong????


[11/22/2022 02:12] faithxia
you are cloning using `--recurse-submodules` right? If so, based on what you said, the only difference seems to be that you haven't run `foundryup`. I know that's just to update to the latest foundry, but just making sure you've done that before running `forge i`


[11/22/2022 02:15] ladboy233
Thanks. What is the foundry version you used?


[11/22/2022 02:15] ladboy233
This is the one I use.


[11/22/2022 02:15] ladboy233
forge 0.2.0 (8b0af47 2022-11-05T22:24:55.0374315Z)

ok let me try


[11/22/2022 02:21] ladboy233
😢


[11/22/2022 02:36] ladboy233
I would appreciate if anyone share their steps if you are using windows and you get the test running successfully.


[11/22/2022 02:48] ladboy233
I give up. Same error again 🙂


[11/22/2022 02:50] faithxia
you could try using WSL2, that's worked for me


[11/22/2022 02:51] faithxia (pinned)
installing foundry in WSL2 is a one step process (install -> restart terminal), and then as long as you have `git` installed, you can run the exact `debugging` command and test it out


[11/22/2022 02:52] faithxia
not sure what code editor you use but visual studio code works out of the box with WSL2 as well, so no real reason not to use it at this point


[11/22/2022 02:52] ladboy233
ok thanks


[11/22/2022 02:53] ladboy233
🥲


[11/22/2022 03:11] ladboy233

yes just quickly reinstalled my OS since ubuntu 18 didnt suport foundryup due to glibc issues but now ubuntu22 does and now got the tests running!. Looks like you need the absolute latest version of forge available through foundryup, and if you have compiled form source, try pulling again and recompiling! or make the switch to foundryup like i did

sorry for the late response, clearing forge's cache is a potential fix also (as an alternative to reinstalling forge entirely)

the base principle is the same: we're creating an augmented version of a protocol's token and offering manual and automated means of managing the tokens' rewards, as well as providing the ability to mint future yield tokens (coming later for Pirex-GMX - not part of the audit yet)

fsGLP is fee + staked GLP and it earns protocol rewards

[11/22/2022 18:25] ppmoon69
within the context of the PirexRewards contract, `ProducerToken` = the Pirex-GMX tokens which produce rewards and the associated reward state


[11/22/2022 18:30] ppmoon69
can you provide more details regarding the errors you're seeing with the former command?


[11/22/2022 18:30] ppmoon69
the snapshot command is in the scripts/forgeTest.sh file and uses pretty much the same options + values

hey, confused about the globalstate and userstate reward var. what is it supposed to be measuring exactly?


[11/23/2022 18:12] kiki_dev
To build off of that I want to make sure I’m also understanding this correctly. Pxgmx is a liquid wrapped version of gmx. Gmx is the dexs token where holders of gmx get rewards from fees. The rewards come in the form of various tokens such as eth avax usdc.   So in the context of the pirexRewards contract:  ProducerTokens has an array of rewardTokens. And this array holds a variety of erc20 tokens. And when a user claims their  reward they will be getting multiple types of tokens?


[11/23/2022 18:30] ppmoon69
Quickly reiterating/confirming what you said...

pxGMX = wrapped form of GMX and esGMX tokens + all the rewards and rights associated with them (those tokens are blackholed and can never be redeemed) 

The rewards are WETH or WAVAX (one or the other, depending on chain), multiplier points, and esGMX 

Now, to answer your question: yes, users may get multiple types of tokens as rewards, but this is not always the case - e.g. GLP may not produce esGMX rewards, so users will only get WETH (in this specific example, the lack of esGMX rewards is not decided by us, but by GMX)

[11/24/2022 15:30] koolexc
What's the strategy for the user to earn more rewards. will the user benefit if they claim rewards as early as possible or they just leave it for long time ?


[11/24/2022 15:56] adriro
note that there's an incentive fee to call compound so likely keepers/bots


[11/24/2022 16:03] neumoxx
Ah, ok, missed that. Thx!


[11/24/2022 17:07] ppmoon69
they can claim rewards and use them to acquire more pxGMX or pxGLP, which increases the amount of rewards earned (this is done automatically via an auto-compounding vault)

[11/25/2022 13:51] adriro
There's a difference in how each one compounds (you can see that in their respective compound funcs). Also pxglp tracks pxgmx rewards (seems these are not compounded into glp but kept as gmx).


[11/25/2022 13:52] adriro
Does anyone know if multiplier points also boost staked glp rewards? GMX docs are not that clear, I guess points only boost gmx rewards but not 100% sure.


[11/25/2022 14:20] ppmoon69
you can't redeem pxGMX the same way that you can with pxGLP, but you can swap it via our Curve pool, which we're planning to seed liquidity for


[11/25/2022 14:21] ppmoon69
if you can validate the finding prior to submission, we'd greatly appreciate it - would save everyone a lot of time and is a good practice


[11/25/2022 14:21] ppmoon69
you should confirm that it's a bug before submitting


[11/25/2022 14:22] ppmoon69
you can ask questions in this channel, which would benefit other wardens as well


[11/25/2022 14:40] ppmoon69
when they say "boosting", it really just means that you're earning rewards for tokens that you don't actually have. if you have 10 GMX, and 10 multiplier points, you'd be earning the equivalent of 20 GMX in rewards (2x what you'd earn if you only had the 10 GMX)


[11/25/2022 14:43] ppmoon69
technically, MP does "boost" staked GLP indirectly, since it earns esGMX, which earns MP

GMX rewards are issued every second, but the amount is variable


[11/26/2022 13:40] ppmoon69
PirexRewards stores an abstract representation of those rewards so that the amount that token holders receive is based on their balances and the amount of time they've held those tokens for


[11/26/2022 13:41] ppmoon69
you can find every GMX contract here https://gmxio.gitbook.io/gmx/contracts

the only rewards distributed are WETH or WAVAX, and esGMX-backed pxGMX

Hi
Could you please tell what is the difference between `rewardTrackerGmx` and `stakedGmx`? 

And `rewardTrackerGlp`, `feeStakedGlp` and `stakedGlp`

In `PirexGmx`

And provide addresses for each of them in arbitrum please


[11/26/2022 17:23] ppmoon69
My suggestion is to look through the link I shared above

[11/26/2022 17:31] R2#8087
Yes, I see `StakedGmx` and `StakedGlp` there
But what is `rewardTrackerGmx` and `rewardTrackerGlp` and where to find them?


[11/26/2022 17:36] R2#8087
Found accordance in `configureGmxState`: 

```
        rewardTrackerGmx = RewardTracker(gmxRewardRouterV2.feeGmxTracker());
        rewardTrackerGlp = RewardTracker(gmxRewardRouterV2.feeGlpTracker());
        feeStakedGlp = RewardTracker(gmxRewardRouterV2.stakedGlpTracker());
        stakedGmx = RewardTracker(gmxRewardRouterV2.stakedGmxTracker());
        glpManager = gmxRewardRouterV2.glpManager();
        gmxVault = IVault(IGlpManager(glpManager).vault());
```

But it wasn't obvious by naming


[11/26/2022 17:39] ppmoon69
Those are variable names. You need to look at their types


[11/26/2022 17:40] ppmoon69
Most of the ones you listed share the same exact contract types


[11/26/2022 17:41] ppmoon69
Their differences are in how they're configured or interact with one another within the GMX contract set


[11/26/2022 17:41] R2#8087
Yes, sure
I just wanted to check if RewardsRouter calls `claimForAccount()` for each of them


[11/26/2022 17:42] R2#8087
Thank you

I tried call depositGlpETH function in a testcase but I get this error


[11/27/2022 00:51] mahdi9606
It's solved , the problem was that I used Fuzzer input as amount to deposit and sometimes it is lower that minUsdg and face this error .

what is the reason for this check?
```
    if (feeAmount != 0)
         gmxBaseReward.safeTransfer(address(pirexFees), feeAmount);
```


[11/28/2022 10:25] codeislight
to not waste gas if the feeAmount is zero


[11/28/2022 10:53] un_for_given
is that the only reason?


[11/28/2022 10:55] Franfran#5067
Any reason why the compound incentive is opted out for those which are called in the `redeem()`, `withdraw()`, ... functions ?


[11/28/2022 12:52] ppmoon69
yes


[11/28/2022 12:54] ppmoon69
for the sake of simplicity in terms of accounting, and because `compound` is called as a side effect and not in an intentional way that mitigates manipulation

[11/28/2022 23:21] JohnSmith#1623
Since we are done here, can someone explain why do we have an `assert` here?
```
src/PirexGmx.sol
223: postFeeAmount = assets - feeAmount;

225: assert(feeAmount + postFeeAmount == assets);
```
What is the purpose of it?


[11/29/2022 05:01] codeislight
it's a sanity check, so it shall never fail


[11/29/2022 05:04] codeislight
in that context it looks like to be unnecessary, since even in the case which is unlikely of overflow, the tx will just revert


[11/29/2022 10:17] ppmoon69
It's to ensure that the exact amount of assets "distributed" (e.g. pxGMX minted for the depositor and fee distributor contract) is as it should be


[11/29/2022 10:18] ppmoon69
> e.g. pxGMX minted for the depositor and fee distributor contract

Clarifying this specific example: we would never mint more or less pxGMX than what was actually deposited into the protocol


[11/29/2022 10:20] ppmoon69
We're using solidity 0.8+ so we're not concerned with int over/underflows outside of unchecked blocks

[11/29/2022 11:38] pavankv
can we  use require alternate of assert here .. ?


[11/29/2022 12:37] Franfran#5067
It would almost have the same behaviour, assert instead must be used for unreachable patterns and it panics

[11/30/2022 18:22] chaduke3730
@pavankvthey just return different error code. I think assert will return a panic code, which is more serious

{Reactions}
👍 

[11/30/2022 22:17] 0xbanky
`require` and `assert` do pretty much the same thing, when they fail they both revert. They are used differently though to convey meaning - `require` is usually used to verify that the inputs to a function are valid whereas `assert` is used to verify that the function itself works as expected and all the correct invariants are held

big props to me for submitting to the wrong contest.
Not sure if it was a bug or just me, but the fact that Canto didn't had a picture maybe didn't helped. Lesson learned for the next time, don't do like me.

i hope that the team can reconsider it to be eligible, since both of them had the same deadline, so at least you didn't break that rule.
